/* "What We Do" — v8, built from the design conversation before it, not
   from another structural gimmick. Every earlier attempt (a diagram, an
   accordion, a notebook, a ledger, a heavy-motion showcase, a drawn
   skyline) optimized for "what's a clever container/technique" —
   which is exactly why each one read as impressive-but-off rather than
   right for a three-decade property developer. The brief that actually
   matters here: this is an institution, not a startup: real photography
   of real work carries the weight, not illustration or metaphor;
   confidence reads as restraint, not density of tricks; and image and
   text each get their own uncluttered space rather than fighting for
   the same pixels under a scrim.

   So this is a slow photo essay: one full-bleed hero, a quiet editorial
   mission statement in pure typography, then five chapters — each a
   large real photograph on its own, followed immediately by its own
   caption band (index, title, description, one real figure) laid out
   like a magazine's caption/credits line, not overlaid on the image.
   Motion is limited to one register throughout — a soft rise-and-fade
   on scroll, a subtle parallax on the photos — no cursor, no marquee,
   no ghost-numeral spectacle, no diagram. Repetition across the five
   chapters is deliberate, not a missed opportunity for variation: a
   calm, consistent rhythm is itself what confidence looks like here. */
