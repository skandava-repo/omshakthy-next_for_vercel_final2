/* "What We Do" — v10, a direct, deliberate clone of a supplied reference
   comp (a "Capability Statement" layout: cream two-column page, an
   ornate stat card on the left, five icon+photo+copy rows on the
   right). This file is NOT an original design pass like every other
   version here — it exists to match that reference as closely as code
   can reproduce it: same copy, same layout proportions, same palette,
   same iconography, same decorative details (corner-bracketed stat
   card, ghosted skyline watermark, lotus glyphs, skewed photo cards,
   gold arrows). The one thing that can't be reproduced exactly is the
   reference's own photography and background illustration — those are
   specific AI-generated images this project doesn't have the source
   files for — so real site photography (the same five discipline shots
   used elsewhere on this site) stands in for them, laid out and clipped
   the same way the reference's photos are. */

  // to fit that leftover space directly, silently clipping whichever
  // column's natural content needed more room than that (confirmed at
  // a laptop's 768px-tall viewport: the stat card's "Years in
  // Operation" label). useScaleToFit measures .wc__stage's real,
  // natural size against what .wc__body actually has and shrinks the
  // whole two-column row as one rigid unit when it doesn't fit — see
  // that hook's own comment for the full reasoning — same hook already
  // fixed the identical symptom in LeadersSection. CinematicTimeline and
  // TestimonialsSection were checked at the same viewport and don't
  // currently need it (their content already fits), so it wasn't added
  // there — this isn't applied blanket across every section, only where
