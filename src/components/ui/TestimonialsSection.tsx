/* Large featured card — auto-advances through ALL of `reviews` (all 7,
   written + video ones alike) on its own timer, completely independent
   of the video tiles either side of it: no shared index, no relationship
   to which tile (if any) a screen reader/sighted user is looking at.
   Keyed on `activeKey` (the rotation index) rather than the review's own
   name/identity, purely so Framer always sees a "new" key on every
   advance — irrelevant now that this cycles the full, non-repeating
   `reviews` list (name collisions were only a videoReviews problem), but
   using the index is still the simpler, more obviously-correct choice
   than a value that happens to also be unique here. `reduce` collapses the
   transition to an instant swap, same pattern the Odometer above uses for
   prefers-reduced-motion rather than relying on the CSS media query alone
   (Framer's animate/exit props aren't touched by that media query on
   their own — they need to be told directly).

   The navy card frame (.tw-featured — background, border, shadow, brand
   mark, quote mark) is now completely static; only the actual per-review
   content (.tw-featured-body: quote + cite) is what animates, sliding
   horizontally like flipping through pages inside a fixed window. Earlier
   attempts (a literal 3D rotateY flip, then a fade+scale+drift) both
   moved the ENTIRE card as one rigid block — that's very likely what read
   as unstable/wrong: the whole navy frame jumping or spinning on every
   auto-advance. Keeping the frame still and only sliding the content is
   the more standard, reliably-polished pattern for quote/testimonial
   carousels. Same proven easing curve as before
   (cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)) — already used elsewhere in this codebase
   (the original deck's card transitions, LeadersSection's card
   entrances), not reinvented per attempt. */
